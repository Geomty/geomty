# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Hey fellow stranger on my profile. I'm Geomty, and I code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (I don't know too much though). ðŸ¤“

My journey starts a couple months ago when I watched a documentary on coding, it completely inspired me. I was already pretty good with computers, programming would have been the perfect hobby for me. I'm always striving to learn more, knowledge is a powerful thing. ðŸ§ 

My main project at the moment is a discord bot named [Geometer,](https://www.geometer.tk) discord.js is pretty much the only thing I'm not too terrible at. Maybe I should start something new, I'll think about it. ðŸ¤”

If you want to find out more about me or get in touch with me, visit my website [here.](https://geomty.github.io) Who knows, we could make great friends. ðŸ˜Š
